This project is related to a storyline related to a zombie apocolypse. 
In a dystopian world, zombies have created havoc everywhere. There was no cure to this until now, when a scientist created a vaccine which can make the survivors immune and the zombies dead.
## You, as a soldier, are tasked to drop the package containing vaccines for the survivors.
